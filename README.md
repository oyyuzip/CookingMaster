Place requested ingredients on cutting board to chop them into salads. Then pick up the finished salad and give it to the correct customer before they get mad and leave. Whichever chef delivers the most customer satisfaction before time runs out is the winner.

NOTES:
  Camera was deliberately left static as I felt it important to see everything that's going on in the room all at once.
  Pickups have not yet been implemented, but code has been set up with them in mind and should be easy to integrate.
  I know cheese isn't a vegetable, but it seemed like a good thing to put in a salad.
